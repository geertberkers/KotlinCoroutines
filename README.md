# KotlinCoroutinesUnitTests

Created this project to learn about Kotlin Coroutines

Quick link to Coroutines Test:
 [Kotlin Coroutines Unit Tests](https://github.com/geertberkers/KotlinCoroutinesUnitTests/tree/master/app/src/test/java/geert/berkers/kotlincoroutines)

This project contains a Android Project with simple test functions.
This was just for simple running and testing.
So there are no actual asserts. I might add them later
